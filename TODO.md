# Requirements:
- You should have at least five models. 

- Some methods in your models. There should be at least twenty methods total in your models. These are to be used to better extract data from your tables. If all of your logic is in your controller, you're making a mistake. Talk to instructor if you're confused about the type of methods that might go on your models.

- No APIs until you get approval from an instructor. If your app completely works with dummy data and you have time left over, you can ask an instructor if you can start working with an API.

- An analytics page - The main learning goal of this is to get you to write some interesting activerecord queries.

- No JavaScript. Stay focused on Rails for this project - we'll have plenty of time this semeseter to cover JS topics.
